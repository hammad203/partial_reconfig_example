# Partial Reconfiguration Example

This is a demo with partial reconfiguration with the PYNQ framework. 
The PYNQ image version has to be v2.4 and above (not yet released; please be patient).
This is to be compatible with the 2018.3 Xilinx tools.

The demo will show different LED patterns on a ZCU104 board.
